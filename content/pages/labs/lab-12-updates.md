*   If you're using a Mac (OS X Lion), you'll need to install the PL2303 driver as explained on [this blog post](http://xbsd.nl/2011/07/pl2303-serial-usb-on-osx-lion.html).
    
*   Use "sudo bash" or "sudo tcsh" to get a root shell before following their instructions. This will allow you to use the USB-serial dongles we'll use to connect to the modem hardware today and thursday.
